This is the second version of the package. I have fixed some bugs without adding any significant new features. The changes are done to get PPforest and the new dplyr version working together smoothly. The checks are done with the dplyr development version 0.7.4.9001 and will become 0.7.5 upon release (on March 28).


# Test Environments
* local OS X (Sierra) install, R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.3

# R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs, one Note.
